One study showed that drinking a half-liter (17 ounces) of water about half an hour before meals helped dieters eat fewer calories and lose 44% more weight, compared to those who didn’t drink the water"
				+ "\n\nEat Eggs For Breakfast.Eating whole eggs can have all sorts of benefits, including helping you lose weight. Studies show that replacing a grain-based breakfast with eggs can help you eat fewer calories for the next 36 hours as well as lose more weight and body fat (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source). If you don’t eat eggs, that's fine. Any source of quality protein for breakfast should do the trick."
